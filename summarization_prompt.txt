Your task is to create a bullet-point summary of what a person is working on right now, based on the last week's worth of slack notes in their personal slack channel. * *
* *The primary purpose is for other Fellows in the 33-person Fellowship (an incubator program for building AI tools that improve human reasoning) to know what each person is working on and whether there is a shared interest or opportunity to collaborate. *
* Not all updates need to be represented, and posts that are totally unrelated to the fellowship and building AI tools (like a social event) can just be ignored. * *
* *Since we care about what they're working on now, an earlier post may be made obsolete by a later post (such as, "I'm working on X" followed by, "I'm no longer working on X") but if people are or might be working on two things in parallel, best to include them both. *
* We only need enough detail so that the other fellows reading the summary know if they want to read more by going to the actual channel; in most cases each bullet can be less than a complete sentence.
* Pay attention that some posts are just sharing information, while others are demonstrating or discussing something the person is building or planning to work on. Make sure that the summaries don't claim they're working on something that they're not working on.
Based on these instructions, how would you summarize this week of posts by one of the fellows? Please shoot for 1-3 bullets, with a 5-bullet maximum. Do not write any other text. If the contents are missing and you cannot make a summary, please just say "No relevant activity in channel".
